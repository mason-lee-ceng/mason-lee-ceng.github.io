### Overview

We built this site to help students and companies find each other through a shared portal. Companies can post roles and filter students based on their ideal skills, while students can search for companies and opportunities that match their own interests and experiences through profile filtering. The system streamlines career discovery at UH by offering a centralized platform for internships and jobs.

### Mason’s Role

Some of my contributions included creating initial mockups to guide the layout and flow of the site, designing and building the Student Profile page and Add Company page, and refining the layout for contact cards to ensure better readability and consistency. I also worked on updating the Developer Guide with clear setup and contribution instructions, and finalized our project documentation. Throughout the development process, I helped other team members when they had questions or ran into blockers, contributing to a collaborative and supportive workflow.

### Know–Want to Know–Learned

- **Know**: At the start, we already had some familiarity with the tech stack from class projects, including React, TypeScript, Next.js, and PostgreSQL. We also had experience working in teams using GitHub and Agile methodologies.
- **Want to Know**: I wanted to learn how to take a design from mockup to a working feature in a collaborative environment, and how to handle documentation and developer resources for a multi-contributor project.
- **Learned**: I learned how impactful good UI layout decisions can be, and how important it is to keep code organized and well-documented. Working on multiple parts of the site gave me a broader understanding of our system, and I saw firsthand how supporting teammates and maintaining documentation helps the entire project run more smoothly.
