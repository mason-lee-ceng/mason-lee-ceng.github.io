  The University of Hawaii Drone Technologies (UHDT) team is one of the many Vertically Integrated Project (VIP) teams within the College of Engineering at the University of Hawaii at Manoa. As a multidisciplinary team, UHDT brings together students from various engineering disciplines, including Electrical, Mechanical, Computer, and Civil Engineering. The team is open to students of all levels, from freshmen to seniors, providing a collaborative environment where members can gain hands-on experience in drone design, development, and implementation.

  The objective of the UHDT initiative is to develop an autonomous Unmanned Aerial System (UAS), an autonomous Air Delivery System, and an autonomous Image Processing System capable of accurately delivering payloads to designated ground targets.  This initiative aligns with the regulations set forth for the 2025 SUAS Competition and is part of an internal Game of Drones competition, providing students with opportunities to apply their skills in autonomous navigation, control systems, and computer vision while adhering to real-world industry and competition standards. The competition 
  
  The mission begins with Mission Preparation, where the Ground Control System (GCS) receives GPS coordinates, generates waypoints, and loads strobing beacon payloads into the drone. Following this, the Takeoff phase occurs, where the drone lifts off either autonomously or manually. Once airborne, the drone embarks on a three-mile Waypoint Lap, flying at top speed to reach the Search Area. Upon arrival, the drone reduces speed and hovers at 75 feet, scanning the ground to identify targets such as vehicles, trash cans, or umbrellas.
